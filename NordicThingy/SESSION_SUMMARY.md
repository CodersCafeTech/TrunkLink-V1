- System initialization states
- LoRa communication states
- GPS/GNSS states
- Edge Impulse ML inference states
- Emergency alert states
- Location transmission states

---

## 🔧 **Work Completed**

### 1. **LED State Management System Design** ✅
- **Created comprehensive LED color scheme** with 25+ distinct states
- **Designed state hierarchy** with emergency states taking priority
- **Mapped LED colors to system functions**:
  - 🔴 Red: Errors and emergency alerts
  - 🟢 Green: Success states and system ready
  - 🔵 Blue: Active operations (ML inference, data transmission)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Initialization states
  - 🟠 Orange: Network operations
  - 🟣 Purple/Magenta: Search/waiting states
  - 🩵 Cyan: Hardware initialization
  - ⚪ White: System boot

### 2. **LED Hardware Configuration** ✅
**MAJOR DISCOVERY**: LED pin mapping was incorrect in documentation!

**Original (Incorrect) Configuration:**
```c
#define LED_RED_PIN   29  // P0.29
#define LED_GREEN_PIN 30  // P0.30
#define LED_BLUE_PIN  31  // P0.31
// Polarity: Active LOW (0=ON, 1=OFF)
```

**Final (VERIFIED) Configuration:**
```c
#define LED_RED_PIN   29  // P0.29 controls RED LED
#define LED_GREEN_PIN 31  // P0.31 controls GREEN LED ← SWAPPED
#define LED_BLUE_PIN  30  // P0.30 controls BLUE LED  ← SWAPPED
// Polarity: Active HIGH (1=ON, 0=OFF) ← INVERTED
```

**Discovery Process:**
1. **Test 1**: Expected R,G,B → Got red, purple, white
2. **Test 2**: Expected R,G,B → Got blue, rose, yellow, white
3. **Test 3**: Expected R,G,B → Got green, blue, red ✅
4. **Final**: Mapped pins correctly based on actual hardware behavior

### 3. **Code Implementation** ✅

#### **Files Created:**
- `src/led_states.h` - LED state definitions and function prototypes
- `src/led_states.cpp` - LED state management implementation
- `LED_STATES_GUIDE.md` - Complete user documentation

#### **Files Modified:**
- `src/main.cpp` - Integrated LED state calls throughout system flow
- `src/CMakeLists.txt` - Added led_states.cpp to build

#### **Key Implementation Details:**
- **37 distinct LED states** covering all system operations
- **Thread-safe LED control** with mutex protection
- **Active HIGH polarity** (1=ON, 0=OFF) - corrected from documentation
- **Emergency state priority** - emergency alerts override other states
- **Non-blocking LED patterns** - don't interfere with system operations

### 4. **System Integration** ✅

**LED States Added Throughout main.cpp:**
- **System Initialization** (4 states)
- **LoRa Operations** (9 states)
- **GPS/GNSS Operations** (7 states)
- **ML/Edge Impulse** (6 states)
- **Emergency Handling** (4 states)
- **Location Transmission** (3 states)
- **Error States** (4+ states)

**Strategic Placement:**
```cpp
// System boot
led_set_state(LED_STATE_SYSTEM_INIT);

// LoRa initialization
led_set_state(LED_STATE_LORA_INITIALIZING);
// ... success/failure states

// GPS operations
led_set_state(LED_STATE_GPS_SEARCHING);
// ... fix acquired/timeout states

// Fall detection
led_set_state(LED_STATE_FALL_DETECTED);
// ... emergency alert states

// Operational feedback
led_set_state(LED_STATE_ML_INFERENCING); // Every 5s
```

### 5. **Compilation Fixes** ✅
**Issues Resolved:**
- **Undefined GNSS constants** - removed unsupported nRF9151 API calls
- **Unused variable warnings** - added `__attribute__((unused))` markers
- **Double precision warnings** - changed `10.0` to `10.0f`
- **C++ linkage issues** - proper extern "C" wrapper in header
- **Build system integration** - correct CMakeLists.txt inclusion

### 6. **Documentation** ✅
**Created LED_STATES_GUIDE.md with:**
- **Complete color reference** - all 25+ LED states explained
- **Startup sequence guide** - expected LED progression
- **Emergency state patterns** - critical alert identification
- **Troubleshooting guide** - diagnose issues by LED color
- **Hardware specifications** - verified pin mapping and polarity
- **Quick reference card** - key states at-a-glance

## 🚀 **Expected System Behavior**

### **Normal Startup Sequence (2-5 minutes total):**
1. ⚪ **WHITE** (3 blinks) → System initializing
2. 🟣 **MAGENTA** (5 blinks) → ML system initializing
3. 🟢 **GREEN** (1 blink) → ML ready
4. 🟡 **YELLOW** (5 blinks) → LoRa initializing
5. 🟢 **GREEN** (2 blinks) → LoRa initialized
6. 🟠 **ORANGE** (slow alternating) → Joining LoRaWAN network
7. 🟢 **GREEN** (double blink) → Network joined
8. 🩵 **CYAN** (5 blinks) → GPS initializing
9. 🟢 **GREEN** (1 blink) → GPS initialized
10. 🟣 **PURPLE** (every 30s) → GPS searching for fix
11. 🟢 **GREEN** (solid 2s) → GPS fix acquired
12. 🟢 **GREEN** (solid 2s) → **ALL SYSTEMS READY!**

### **Operational States:**
- 🔵 **BLUE** (fast pulse every 5s) → ML inference running
- 🔵 **BLUE** (3 blinks every 5min) → Routine location update

### **Emergency Sequence:**
1. 🔴 **RED** (urgent flashing) → **FALL DETECTED!**
2. 🔵 **BLUE** (fast blinks) → Sending emergency data
3. 🔴🔵 **RED+BLUE** (alternating) → Emergency location sent

## 🛠️ **Technical Challenges Solved**

### **Challenge 1: LED Pin Mapping Mystery**
- **Problem**: Documentation showed wrong pin assignments
- **Investigation**: Systematic testing with R,G,B sequence
- **Discovery**: Pins 30 and 31 were swapped, polarity was inverted
- **Solution**: Empirical testing to determine actual hardware mapping

### **Challenge 2: LED Polarity Issues**
- **Problem**: Expected active LOW, but LEDs were active HIGH
- **Symptoms**: Colors appearing when LEDs should be OFF
- **Solution**: Changed from `gpio_pin_set(pin, red ? 0 : 1)` to `gpio_pin_set(pin, red ? 1 : 0)`

### **Challenge 3: Build System Integration**
- **Problem**: Linker errors with undefined LED functions
- **Root Cause**: C vs C++ compilation, missing extern "C" wrapper
- **Solution**: Proper header wrapping and CMakeLists.txt integration

### **Challenge 4: nRF9151 API Compatibility**
- **Problem**: GPS system mask functions don't exist in this SDK version
- **Error**: `nrf_modem_gnss_system_mask_set` undefined
- **Solution**: Simplified GPS configuration using defaults
